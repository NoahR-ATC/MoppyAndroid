    - Modified to use jp.kshoji.javax.sound.midi instead of javax.sound.midi to allow for Android support

    - com.moppy.core.events.mapper.MIDIScriptMapper removed as it is unused in MoppyAndroid and wasn't worth porting

Notes:
    - Would have had to update com.moppy.core.device.DeviceDescriptor by hand due to issues delomboking, but no changes were made upstream
    - Manually merged com.moppy.core.comms.bridge.BridgeSerial due to extensive local changes
    - Manually merged com.moppy.core.midi.MoppyMIDISequencer due to issues delomboking and local changes
